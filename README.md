# WiCast
Broadcast and listen for messages within your local area network via WiFi -- for iOS and Android

iOS-iOS communication -- confirmed working  
Android-iOS communication -- inconclusive (my Android device is out of commission)  
PC(netcat)-iOS communication -- confirmed working  
PC(netcat)-Android communication -- does not work (see below)  
  
Android Studio Emulator lacks the ability connect to WiFi. Within the Emulator, broadcast and reception works as expected. On a physical device, behavior is unpredictable.
